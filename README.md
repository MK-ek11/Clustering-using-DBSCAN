# Apply DBSCAN algorithm for clustering and outlier detection
## Description
Course: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (Fall 2021) <br />
Task: Write own code


> Density-based clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. DBSCAN is a simple and eﬀective density-based clustering algorithm that illustrates a number of important concepts that are important for any density-based clustering approach.
>
> In this section we discuss the center-based approach on which DBSCAN is based. 
>
> In the center-based approach, density is estimated for a particular point in the data set by counting the number of points within a speciﬁed radius, Eps , of that point. This includes the point itself.
